# Day 1 - Onboard Platform Engineers

:::info What to expect
You have [started with WGE](../install-enterprise-getting-started) and already familiar with its [bootstrapping workflow](../install-enterprise-getting-started/#bootstrapping).
You want to iterate your environment to onboard other Platform Engineers and finally Developers.

Use this guide to adopt the recommendations that would enable you to do so with confidence.
:::

## Authentication

As a reminder, Weave GitOps Enterprise supports as authentication methods, Cluster User, that you have likely setup as part of the previous step, and OIDC.
OIDC is the recommended way for production, so take the time to set it up before onboarding other users.

### Setup OIDC

:::warning
Currently, we do not have a persistent session storage, this means that if you scale to multiple replicas, logins will not be persisted.
:::

To login via your OIDC provider two steps are required:

1. **Create a Kubernetes secret `oidc-auth` with the OIDC configuration**. This configuration consists of the following parameters:

:::tip
For specific OIDC providers configuration (like Google or Azure) see [this guide](../../../guides/oidc/).
:::

| Parameter         |  Description                                                                                                                      | Default   |
| ------------------|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `issuerURL`       |  The URL of the issuer; typically, the discovery URL without a path                                                                |           |
| `clientID`        |  The client ID set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                                 |           |
| `clientSecret`    |  The client secret set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                             |           |
| `redirectURL`     |  The redirect URL set up for Weave GitOps in the issuerâ€”typically the dashboard URL, followed by `/oauth2/callback ` |           |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `oidcUsernamePrefix` | The prefix added to users when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-username-prefix | |
| `oidcGroupsPrefix` | The prefix added to groups when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-groups-prefix | |

Ensure that your OIDC provider has been set up with a client ID/secret and the dashboard's redirect URL.

2. **Configure WGE to use OIDC**

<Tabs groupId="authentication" default>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

Execute `gitops bootstrap auth` to complete the task:

```bash
# Add OIDC configuration to your environment
gitops bootstrap auth --type=oidc --client-id="client-id" \
    --client-secret="client-secret" \
    --discovery-url="discovery-url"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual" label="Manual">

1. Create a Kubernetes secret `oidc-auth` with the OIDC configuration

```bash
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL="oidc-issuer-url" \
  --from-literal=clientID="client-id" \
  --from-literal=clientSecret="client-secret" \
  --from-literal=redirectURL="redirect-url" \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration="token-duration"
```

2. Configure WGE to use OIDC

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... other spec components
  values:
    config:
      oidc:
        clientCredentialsSecret: oidc-auth
        enabled: true
        issuerURL: "oidc-issuer-url"
        redirectURL: "redirect-url"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the HTTP server starts, unauthenticated users will have to click 'Login With OIDC Provider' to log in.

:::tip Running into issues setting up OIDC?
Use [`gitops check oidc-config`](../../../references/cli-reference/gitops_check_oidc-config/) command to help you troubleshoot your OIDC configuration.

See [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) for other OIDC topics like customise scopes.

## Authorization

Weave GitOps Enterprise works with standard [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for authorization of:

- **Weave GitOps Users:** previously authenticated via either OIDC or Cluster User.
- **Weave GitOps Service Account:** which talks to Kubernetes for user operations via [Impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation).
- **Flux Service Accounts:** which talks to Kubernetes for deployments operations.

### RBAC for OIDC Users

During [getting started](../install-enterprise-getting-started/) you have created the default authorization clusters for `Cluser User`, `Weave GitOps Service Account`
and `Flux Service Accounts` but not for OIDC users. You could setup Authorization for OIDC users by defining and deploying the RBAC rules.

#### Define the Rules

RBAC rules are highly context-dependent and there is no one-size fits all. You would need to take the time with your Security organisation on defining them.

We provide you with the following RBAC Configuration as inspirational to get you conversations started. It is purposefully vague as we intend to give a
broad idea of how to implement such a system. The specifics will dependent on your circumstances and goals.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see a Example RBAC Configuration</summary>

Our general recommendation is to use OIDC and a small number of groups that Weave GitOps can impersonate.

Configuring Weave GitOps to impersonate Kubernetes groups rather than users has the following benefits:
* A user's permissions for impersonation by Weave GitOps can be separate from
any other permissions that they may or may not have within the cluster.
* Users do not have to be individually managed within the cluster and can have
their permissions managed together.

**Design**

Assume that your company has the following people in OIDC:
* Aisha, a cluster admin, who should have full admin access to Weave GitOps
* Brian, lead of Team-A, who should have admin permissions to their team's
namespace in Weave GitOps and read-only otherwise
* June and Jo, developers in Team-A who should have read-only access to Weave GitOps

You can then create three groups:

* `wego-admin`
    - Bound to the `ClusterRole`, created by Helm, `wego-admin-cluster-role`
    - Aisha is the only member
* `wego-team-a-admin`
    - Bound to a `Role`, using the same permissions as `wego-admin-role`, created
    in Team-A's namespace
    - Brian and Aisha are members
* `wego-readonly`
    - Bound to a `ClusterRole` that matches `wego-admin-cluster-role` but with
    no `patch` permissions.
    - Aisha, Brian, June and Jo are all members

**Code**

```yaml
# Admin cluster role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole

  name: wego-admin-cluster-role

:::caution Using OIDC for cluster and Weave GitOps Authentication
If the same OIDC provider is used to authenticate a user with the cluster
itself (e.g. for use with `kubectl`) and to Weave GitOps then, depending
on OIDC configuration, they may end up with the super-set of their permissions
from Weave GitOps and any other permissions granted to them.

This can lead to unintended consequences, like viewing `secrets`. To avoid
this, OIDC providers will often let you configure which groups are returned
to which clients. The Weave GitOps groups should not be returned to the
cluster client (and vice versa).
:::



</details>

#### Deploy them via `/bases`

Once you have the rules defined, you want to ensure they are available in your environment. The `bases` pattern is a useful approach
to easily achieve this. It works as follows:

<Tabs groupId="bases" default>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

:::caution

Not yet supported but planned as part of https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-enterprise/issues/3618

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual" label="Manual">

1. Create a folder in your Git repo in path like `clusters/bases`.
2. Add your RBAC resources into the folder `clusters/bases/rbac`.
3. Create a folder `clusters/management` adding the following `Kustomization`:

```yaml title="clusters/management/clusters-bases-kustomization.yaml"
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: clusters-bases-kustomization
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m0s
  path: clusters/bases
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
```

Save these two files in your Git repository, then commit and push. Flux will deploy the kustomization and the RBAC
resources will be created.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Access the dashboard

During [getting started](../install-enterprise-getting-started/) you have accessed the dashboard via its non-TLS ClusterIP service
which is not enough to onboard other users. Use this section to configure the dashboard access in a secured and reliable manner.

### Configure Dashboard Access

Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard is available by default via ClusterIP service. You could use the `port-forward` command
output as part of the bootstrapping session. Other networking configurations could be achieved by
modifying the `service` or `ingress` in the `HelmRelease` values:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  values:
    service: # update to meet your needs
      ...
    ingress: # update to meet your needs
      ...
```
### Configure TLS

// TODO review

If you're using an ingress controller to terminate TLS you can disable it in the Helm release:

```yaml
  values:
    tls:
      enabled: false
```

Other ingress configuration changes can be made via the ingress configuration

```yaml
  values:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      ... other parameters specific to the ingress type ...
```

## Expand WGE Capabilities

During [getting started](../install-enterprise-getting-started/) you have installed Flux and WGE which allows you to deploy and
view Flux Applications. Expand your environment capabilities by following the section below.

### Enable Write Access to Git

Weave GitOps Enterprise creates pull requests for adding resources. To do this, it needs to be able to write to the Git repository.
Here we provide guidance for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket Server, and Azure DevOps.

<Tabs groupId="git-provider" default>
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">
GitHub requires no additional configuration for OAuth git access
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

Create a GitLab OAuth application that will request `api` permissions to create pull requests on your behalf.

Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).

The application should have at least these scopes:

- `api`
- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`

Add callback URLs to the application for each address the UI will be exposed on, e.g.:

- `https://localhost:8000/oauth/gitlab` for port-forwarding and testing
- `https://git.example.com/oauth/gitlab` for production use

Save your application, taking note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is gitlab
- `GITLAB_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=gitlab"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bitbucket-server" label="BitBucket Server">

Create a new [incoming application link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/configure-an-incoming-link-1108483657.html) from
the BitBucket administration dashboard. You will be asked to enter a unique name and the redirect URL for the external application. The redirect URL
should be set to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/bitbucketserver`. You will also need to select permissions for the application. The minimum set of
permissions needed for WGE to create pull requests on behalf of users is `Repositories - Write`. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>

<img src={oauthBitbucket} width="500"/>

<figcaption>Configuring a new incoming application link</figcaption>
</figure>


Save your application and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is bitbucket-server
- `BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=bitbucket-server"
```

If the secret is already present, use the following command to update it using your default editor:

```bash
kubectl edit secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system
```

:::info

If BitBucket Server is running on the default port (7990), make sure you include the port number in the values of the secret. For example: `GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com:7990=bitbucket-server`

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

Navigate to [VisualStudio](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/app/register) and register a new application, as explained in the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#1-register-your-app). Set the authorization callback URL and select which scopes to grant. Set the callback URL to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/azuredevops`.

Select the `Code (read and write)` scope from the list. This is necessary so that WGE can create pull requests on behalf of users. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOps}/>
<figcaption>Creating a new application</figcaption>
</figure>

After creating your application, you will be presented with the application settings. Take note of the `App ID` and `Client Secret` valuesâ€”you will use them to configure WGE.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOpsSuccess}/>
<figcaption>Application settings</figcaption>
</figure>

In your cluster, create a secret named `git-provider-credentials` that contains the `App ID` and `Client Secret` values from the newly created application.

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_ID='App ID value'" \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_SECRET='Client Secret value'"
```

WGE is now configured to ask users for authorization the next time a pull request must be created as part of using a template.
Note that each user can view and manage which applications they have authorized by navigating to https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/me.

### Enable Cluster Management via Cluster API

TBA

### Enable Policy via Weave Policy

To install [Policy Agent](../../policy/intro.mdx) follow any of the following approaches:

<Tabs groupId="policy agent" default>
<TabItem value="cli" label="cli">

You could configure this stage by using the following flags and examples:

```bash
 # install Policy Agent alongside Weave GitOps Enterprise
 gitops bootstrap --components-extra="policy-agent"
```

For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="manual">

[Policy agent](../../policy/intro.mdx) comes packaged with the WGE chart. To install it, set the following values:

- `values.policy-agent.enabled`: set to true to install the agent with WGE
- `values.policy-agent.config.accountId`: organization name, used as identifier
- `values.policy-agent.config.clusterId`: unique identifier for the cluster

Commit and push all the files

```bash
git add clusters/management/weave-gitops-enterprise.yaml
git commit -m "Deploy Weave GitOps Enterprise"
git push
```

Flux will reconcile the helm-release and WGE will be deployed into the cluster. You can check the `flux-system` namespace to verify all pods are running.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Enable Infrastructure Management via Tf-Controller



## Advanced Topics

### OIDC

#### Customization

For some OIDC configurations, you may need to customise the requested [scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) or [claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims).

The `oidcUsernamePrefix` and `oidcGroupsPrefix` work in the same way as the Kubernetes [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) command-line options, if you need them for Kubernetes, you will likely need them here.

#### Scopes

By default, the following scopes are requested: "openid","offline_access","email","groups".

The "openid" scope is **mandatory** for OpenID auth and will be added if not provided. The "email" and "groups" scopes are commonly used as unique identifiers in organisations.

"offline_access" allows us to refresh OIDC tokens to keep login sessions alive for as long as a refresh token is valid. You can, however, change the defaults.
```sh
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL=$oidc-issuer-url \
  --from-literal=clientID=$client-id \
  --from-literal=clientSecret=$client-secret \
  --from-literal=redirectURL=redirect-url \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration=token-duration \
  --from-literal=customScopes=custom,scopes
```
The format for the `customScopes` key is a comma-separated list of scopes to request. In this case, "custom", "scopes", and "openid" would be requested.

#### Claims

By default, the following claims are parsed from the OpenID [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken) "email" and "groups". These are presented as the `user` and `groups` when WGE communicates with your Kubernetes API server.

This is equivalent to [configuring](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server) your `kube-apiserver` with `--oidc-username-claim=email --oidc-groups-claim=groups`.

Again, you can configure these from the `oidc-auth` `Secret`.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL=oidc-issuer-url \
  --from-literal=clientID=client-id \
  --from-literal=clientSecret=client-secret \
  --from-literal=redirectURL=redirect-url \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration=token-duration \
  --from-literal=claimUsername=sub \
  --from-literal=claimGroups=groups
```
There are two separate configuration keys. You can override them separately. They should match your `kube-apiserver` configuration.

### Cluster User

#### Update Username or Password

To change either the username or the password, recreate the `cluster-user-auth`
with the new details.

Only one Cluster User can be created this way. To add more users, enable an OIDC provider.

#### Update Permissions

If required, the permissions can be expanded with the `rbac.additionalRules` field in the
[Helm Chart](../../references/helm-reference.md).

Follow the instructions in the next section in order to configure RBAC correctly.

#### Remove It

To remove the Cluster User as a login method, set the following values in the
[Helm Chart](../../references/helm-reference.md):

```yaml
#
adminUser:
  create: false
#
additionalArgs:
- --auth-methods=oidc
#
```
:::caution If you are disabling an already existing Cluster User

If you are disabling an already existing Cluster User, you will need to
manually delete the Kubernetes Secret and any User Roles that were created on
the cluster.

:::

### User Permissions

This section discusses the [Kubernetes permissions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
needed by Weave GitOps application users and groups. At a minimum, a User should be bound to a Role in the `flux-system` namespaceâ€”which is where
Flux stores its resources by defaultâ€”with the following permissions:

```yaml
rules:
  # Flux Resources
  - apiGroups: ["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories", "ocirepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: [ "notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "providers", "alerts" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["infra.contrib.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: ["terraforms"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  # Read access for all other Kubernetes objects
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch" ]
```

For a wider scope, the User can be bound to a ClusterRole with the same set.

On top of this you can add other permissions to view WGE resources like `GitOpsSets` and `Templates`.

#### Flux Resources

The following table lists resources that Flux works with directly.

| API Group                      | Resources                                                               | Permissions      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io    | kustomizations                                                          | get, list, patch |

Weave GitOps needs to be able to query the [CRDs](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/) that Flux uses before it can accurately display Flux state. The
`get` and `list` permissions facilitate this.

The `patch` permissions are used for two features: to suspend and resume
reconciliation of a resource by modifying the 'spec' of a resource,
and to force reconciliation of a resource by modifying resource annotations. These features work in the same way that `flux suspend`,
`flux resume`, and `flux reconcile` does on the CLI.

#### Resources Managed via Flux

| API Group                 | Resources                                                                      | Permissions      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| ""                        | configmaps, secrets, pods, services, persistent volumes, persistent volume claims | get, list, watch |

Weave GitOps reads basic resources so that it can monitor the effect that Flux has
on what's running.

Reading `secrets` enables Weave GitOps to monitor the state of Helm releases
as that's where it stores the [state by default](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/changes_since_helm2/#secrets-as-the-default-storage-driver).
For clarity this these are the Helm release objects _not_ the Flux HelmRelease
resource (which are dealt with by the earlier section).

#### Feedback from Flux

Flux communicates the status of itself primarily via events.
These events will show when reconciliations start and stop, whether they're successful,
and information as to why they're not.



### Customise the UI

#### Login

The label of the OIDC button on the login screen is configurable via a feature flag environment variable.
This can give your users a more familiar experience when logging in.

Adjust the configuration in the Helm `values.yaml` file or the `spec.values` section of the Weave GitOps `HelmRelease` resource:

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: WEAVE_GITOPS_FEATURE_OIDC_BUTTON_LABEL
    value: "Login with ACME"
```





## Next Steps

Here are a couple of options for you to take your next steps with WGE. Explore one option or all of them, in no particular order.

- [Cluster Management](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/intro/): We'll show you how to join WGE to a cluster and install an application on that cluster *without* using Cluster API. But if you prefer using Cluster API, our docs cover that too.
- Install the [Terraform Controller](https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/) to reconcile your Terraform resources in a GitOps way. With Flux and the TF Controller, WGE makes it easy to add Terraform templates to your clusters and continuously reconcile any changes made to the Terraform source manifest.
- Install [Policy agent](../../policy/intro.mdx), which comes packaged with the WGE chart.
