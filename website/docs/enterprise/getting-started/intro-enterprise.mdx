[Weave GitOps Enterprise](https://www.weave.works/product/enterprise-faq/) is a platform engineering solution that extends Kubernetes to manage the platform using the GitOps model. It is a developer friendly Kubernetes application platform for on-premise and cloud deployment and is additive to standard managed Kubernetes tools (e.g., OpenShift, Rancher, EKS, AKS, etc.). WGE offers streamlined operations, enhanced developer productivity, compliance and security, scalability, and growth, and provides trusted support and readiness for production.

- Continue to [Getting Started](#getting-started) to start your Weave GitOpps Enterprise journey.

##  Install

You are a Platform Engineer who is in charge of discovering or setting up Weave GitOps Enterprise (WGE) for your organisation.
We propose you to tackle it in three days:

### Step 1: Getting Started

[**Get your environment setup**](../install-enterprise-getting-started) with limited knowledge about WGE. You want to do some initial discovery or to layout the foundations.

### Step 2: Onboard the team

[**Onboard Platform Engineers**](../install-enterprise-onboard): you want to harden your setup to onboard other Platform Engineers. Other Platform Engineers setup any WGE capabilities for your devs.

[**Onboard Developers**](../install-enterprise-onboard): the platform capabilities have been setup and you ready to start onboard developers.

### Day 2: Operate & Improve

- TBA

## Feature Breakdown

In addition to the features in the OSS edition, Weave GitOps Enterprise
offers the following capabilities, taking your delivery from simple Continuous Delivery to Internal Developer Platform:

### :boat: [Cluster Fleet Management](../../cluster-management/cluster-management-intro.mdx)
Weave GitOps Enterprise (WGE) simplifies cluster lifecycle management at scale—even massive scale. Through pull requests, which make every action recorded and auditable, WGE makes it possible for teams to create, update, and delete clusters across entire fleets. WGE further simplifies the process by providing both a user interface (UI) and a command line interface (CLI) for teams to interact with and manage clusters on-prem, across clouds, and in hybrid environments. WGE works with [Terraform](https://www.weave.works/blog/extending-gitops-beyond-kubernetes-with-terraform), [Crossplane](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-goes-beyond-kubernetes-with-weave-gitops-upbound-s-universal-crossplane), and any Cluster API provider.

### :closed_lock_with_key: [Trusted Application Delivery](../../policy/intro.mdx)
Add policy as code to GitOps pipelines and enforce security and compliance,
application resilience and coding standards from source to production.
Validate policy conformance at every step in the software delivery pipeline:
commit, build, deploy and run time.

### :truck: [Progressive Delivery](../../progressive-delivery/progressive-delivery-flagger-install.mdx)
Deploy into production environments safely using canary, blue/green deployment, and A/B
strategies. Simple, single-file configuration defines success rollback. Measure Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
using observability metrics from Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, and others.

### :infinity: [CD Pipelines](../../pipelines/pipelines-intro.mdx)
Rollout new software from development to production.
Environment rollouts that work with your existing CI system.

### :factory_worker: [Team Workspaces](../../workspaces/intro.mdx)
Allow DevOps teams to work seamlessly together with multi-tenancy,
total RBAC control, and policy enforcement, with integration to enterprise IAM.

### :point_up_2: [Self-Service Templates and Profiles](../../gitops-templates/intro.mdx)
Component profiles enable teams to deploy standard services quickly,
consistently and reliably. Teams can curate the profiles that are available
within their estate ensuring there is consistency everywhere. Using GitOps
it's easy to guarantee the latest, secure versions of any component are
deployed in all production systems.

### :sparkling_heart: Health Status and Compliance Dashboards
Gain a single view of the health and state of the cluster and its workloads.
Monitor deployments and alert on policy violations across apps and clusters.

### :compass: Kubernetes Anywhere
Reduce complexity with GitOps and install across all major target environments
including support for on-premise, edge, hybrid, and multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters.

### :bell: [Critical 24/7 Support](/help-and-support/)
Your business and workloads operate around the clock, and so do we.
