# Step 1 - Getting Started <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />

You are a Platform Engineer who is in charge of discovering or setting up Weave GitOps Enterprise for your organisation.
We propose you the following steps:

1. **Getting Started**: you want to get started quickly with limited knowledge for discovery on the product or to setting up the foundations.
2. **Onboard Platform Engineers**: you want to harden your setup to onboard other Platform Engineers. Other Platform Engineers setup any WGE capabilities for your devs.
3. **Onboard Developers**: the platform capabilities have been setup and you ready to start onboard developers.

This pages covers the first step, Getting Started, where we assume limited knowledge on the product and will
take simple default values to get you up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] You are familiar Weave GitOps Enterprise [Concepts](/docs/references/concepts/).
- [ ] You have a **Git Repository** that you want to bootstrap with **write** permissions to push resources.
- [ ] You have a Kubeconfig pointing to your **Management Cluster** with **cluster-admin** to create resources.
- [ ] You have installed [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#install-the-flux-cli) and [Weave GitOps Enterprise CLI](#install-weave-gitops-enterprise-cli)
- [ ] You have **Weave GitOps Enterprise Entitlements** provided by [Sales](/help-and-support/).

:::warning Write Modes & Permissions
Bootstrapping requires you to have both **cluster admin** permissions on the Management Cluster and **push** permissions
to the Git repository to write the generated resources. In the case that you want just to generate the manifests but don't apply them,
you could use Manual route or use the CLI with the `--export` flag.
:::

### Install GitOps CLI
   <Tabs groupId="weave-gitops-cli" default="homebrew">
   <TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

   ```bash
    brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops-ee
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

   ```bash
    export VERSION=$VERSION
    curl --silent --location "https://artifacts.wge.dev.weave.works/releases/bin/${VERSION}/gitops-$(uname)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
    sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
    gitops version
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

### Install Entitlements

Weave GitOps Enterprise Entitlement is your obtained license to use our product. The Entitlements file is a Kubernetes secret that contains your licence.
To get the entitlement secret please contact *sales@weave.works*, then apply it on your management cluster with the name `weave-gitops-enterprise-credentials` under `flux-system` namespace.

```bash
 kubectl apply -n flux-system -f entitlements.yaml
```
## Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a workflow with the following stages:

1. **Bootstrap Flux**: bootstrap Flux on the management cluster.
2. **Entitlements**: provision and verify your Entitlements.
3. **Authentication**: configure how user will authenticate.
4. **Authorization**: configure the access rules for your users and other identities.
5. **Install WGE**: deploy via Flux Weave GitOps Enterprise.
6. **Access the dashboard**: test that you could interact with the application as you expect.

Select from the method below that better match your expectations:

<Tabs groupId="flux bootstrap" default>
<TabItem value="CLI Interactive" label="CLI Interactive">

:::tip You have limited knowledge about the product and / or want guidance step-by-step
:::

 ```bash
 # Run the command to follow the interactive session.
 gitops bootstrap
 ```

<AlphaWarning/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CLI Non Interactive" label="CLI Non Interactive">

:::tip You are already familiar with installing Weave GitOps Enterprise and want to leverage the CLI for convenience
:::

You could run the bootstrap command in non-interactive mode by providing the required configurations as flags. Use `gitops bootstrap --help` for examples to guide you:

```bash
# Bootstrap Weave GitOps Enterprise and Flux over SSH
gitops bootstrap --silent --bootstrap-flux \
    --version="0.38.0" --password="admin-password" \
    --repo-url="ssh://repo-url" --branch="git-branch>" --repo-path="path-management-cluster"  \
    --private-key-path="private-key-path" --private-key-password="private-key-password"

# Add Weave GitOps Enterprise to an existing SSH Flux installation
gitops bootstrap --silent \
    --version="0.38.0" --password="admin-password" \
    --repo-url="ssh://repo-url" --branch="git-branch" --repo-path="path-management-cluster"  \
    --private-key-path="private-key-path" --private-key-password="private-key-password"
```

For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)

:::tip You want to have full control on the process or your context cannot be handled via the CLI.

## Access the dashboard

Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard is available by default via ClusterIP service. You could use the `port-forward` command
output as part of the bootstrapping session or the one below:

```bash
 kubectl -n flux-system port-forward svc/clusters-service 8000:8000
```
Access your browser on http://localhost:8000

Login with the user credentials that you have configured as part of the bootstrapping session.

## Next Steps

Continue with  **Onboard Platform Engineers** to harden your setup to onboard other Platform Engineers.
Other Platform Engineers setup any WGE capabilities for your devs.

## Further Reference

### CLI
