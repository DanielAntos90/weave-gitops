title: Emergency Cluster User Account
---

# Login via the emergency cluster user account

:::danger Important
This is an **insecure** method of securing your dashboard which we only recommend for local
and development environments, or if you need to activate emergency access to a damaged cluster.

Note also that this mechanism only exists for a single user: you will not be able to
create multiple users. Weave GitOps does not provide its own authentication mechanism,
for secure and fully-featured authentication we **strongly recommend** using an OIDC provider as described [here](../oidc-access).
:::

Before you login via the emergency user account, you need to generate a bcrypt hash for your chosen password and store it as a secret in Kubernetes.
There are several different ways to generate a bcrypt hash, this guide uses `gitops get bcrypt-hash` from our CLI:

Generate the password by running:

```sh
PASSWORD="<your password>"
echo -n $PASSWORD | gitops get bcrypt-hash
$2a$10$OS5NJmPNEb13UgTOSKnMxOWlmS7mlxX77hv4yAiISvZ71Dc7IuN3q
```

Now create a Kubernetes secret to store your chosen username and the password hash:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic cluster-user-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password='$2a$10$OS5NJmPNEb13UTOSKngMxOWlmS7mlxX77hv4yAiISvZ71Dc7IuN3q'
```

You should now be able to login via the cluster user account using your chosen username and password.

## User permissions

By default both a ClusterRole and Role are generated for the emergency user.
Both have the same permissions with former being optional and the latter being
bound to the `flux-system` namespace (where Flux stores its resources by default).
The default set of rules are configured like this:

```yaml
rules:
  # Flux Resources
  - apiGroups: ["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories", "ocirepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: [ "notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "providers", "alerts" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["infra.contrib.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: ["terraforms"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  # Read access for all other Kubernetes objects
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch" ]
```

These permissions give the emergency user Administrator level powers. **We do not
advise leaving it active on production systems**.

:::tip
To disable the emergency user, set `adminUser.create` to `false` when deploying
the [Helm Chart](../references/helm-reference.md).
:::

If required, the permissions can be expanded with the `rbac.additionalRules` field in the
[Helm Chart](../references/helm-reference.md).
Follow the instructions in the next section in order to configure RBAC correctly.
